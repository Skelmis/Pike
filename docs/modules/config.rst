Configuration files
===================

Pike relies heavily on the configuration file for essentially all behaviour. If you don't have one, Pike will create a default file for you.

Make sure to fill this out to the best of your ability as this is one of the primary ways to influence behaviour.

.. py:currentmodule:: pike.structs

This is the high level interface:

.. autoclass:: ConfigT
  :members:
  :undoc-members:

The following are nested bits of the config:

.. autoclass:: StylesT
  :members:
  :undoc-members:

.. autoclass:: OutputDocumentsT
  :members:
  :undoc-members:

.. autoclass:: CreationTypesT
  :members:
  :undoc-members:

.. autoclass:: ListT
  :members:
  :undoc-members:
